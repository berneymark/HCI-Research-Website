      <h1>Usability of Wacom Intuos Creative Pen and Touch Tablet</h1>
      <h2>Experiment</h2>
      <h3>Materials</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Wacom Intuos Creative Pen and Touch Tablet with All Accessories and Intructions incl.</li>
        <li>A Computer with ALL Required Drivers Pre-Installed</li>
        <li>Autodesk Sketchbook to Test Stylus On</li>
        <li>A Maze to Run on Sketchbook</li>
        <li>Pen and Paper</li>
        <li>Some Willing Participants</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
      <p>Setting up the basics will be easy and using this is going to have no issues for any user that has previously used stylus', but may come with a learning curve for anyone that is new to them.</p>
      <h3>Method</h3>
      <p>
        Nine people were selected at random to participate in our experiment and be interviewed about the Intuos Stylus to test its usability. To set up the experiment we need to turn off the palm rejection and have the stylus pad unplugged from the computer. The first phase of the experiment the user has been given a set list on instructions to complete in order to pass. First step is to connect the device to the computer, followed by enabling the palm rejection. These results will be recorded as ‘yes’ or ‘no’ dependent on whether they successfully completed each step or not.<br><br>
        The second phase of the experiment is that each person is required to complete a maze that we created for this experiment by going through the maze and minimising the times they touched the walls with the stylus. The amount of times they touched the wall before completing the maze will be counted and recorded into our results.<br><br>
        The final experiment phase involves each person writing their signature on the piece of paper with a pen and the other with the Intuos on Autodesk Sketchbook. Each result shall compare the difference between the two signatures, recorded one to five depending on how recognisable they are. One, being completely unrecognisable and five being exactly the same.<br><br>
        At the conclusion of these experiments we interview each person, asking them five questions about the comfort of using the Wacom Intuos - this included a chance to offer any additional feedback they may or may not have.<br><br>
      </p>
      <h3>Independent Variables</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Wacom Intuos Creative Pen and Touch Tablet</li>
        <li>Pen and Paper Signatures: - this was used against equivalent comparisons from the Wacom Intuos.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Dependent Variables</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Ease of Use: - based upon successful completion of first experiment.</li>
        <li>Precision and Accuracy: - based upon mistakes made in second experiment and results of comparison in the third experiment.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Control Variables</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Autodesk Sketchbook: - this was the <strong>ONLY</strong> used software and each user had it set to the same brush (ballpoint pen) to ensure a repeated experience across our userbase.</li>
          <li>Controlled Environment: - while not all were done in the same place we ensured every user would get a quiet room void of distractions.</li>
          <li>Pen and Paper: - we chose to write with the same brand of ballpoint pens so that each user's reasults were consistent and used A4 paper so space shouldn't have been an issue.</li>
        </ul>
