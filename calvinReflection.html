      <p>I have always had an interest in computers and how they work, therefore I decided to do a degree in Computer Science. But I wasn’t sure in what area I wanted to focus. I have narrowed it down a little and I do like the software side of how computers work, therefore I decided to major in Software Development. Initially taking Computer Science at high school wasn’t a valuable experience so I almost didn’t do Computer Science at University. I picked AUT as it had an undergraduate paper that lead to a degree in Computer Science and I had heard that AUT has a good program for Computer Science, so if I didn’t like it at AUT I was probably going to move on to something else. But I liked creating, problem solving and exploring different ideas through my creativity, this degree so far has met those areas which has caused me to continue pursuing this degree and major.<br><br>

      When looking at this paper I thought it was going to be a boring paper where I need to rope learn facts and write a lot. On top of this, the possibility of taking an exam. I hate taking exams and much prefer to do projects. This is because I can spend time exploring and problem solving which as I mentioned before I enjoy, and I don’t need to rush it like an exam. This leads to me having a greater understanding than if I had just studied for an exam on it. This paper was more focused on understanding and research with only projects and no exams which made me very happy and couldn’t wait to get started on my projects. This was because it was covering a concept that I never thought of which is not creating a product but getting an understanding from a user’s perspective and how they perceive the software or hardware that is developed.<br><br>

      For this assignment we decided to research the usability of the INTUOS stylus to see if users felt it was easy and comfortable to use. As a group we decided to test three users each and then work together on the write up. More specifically we had each member focus on one or two of the following research, introduction, conclusion, experimental write up and website creation. That is how we assigned the roles as a group.<br><br>

      When I started testing I didn’t expect the results were going to be as close to my expectations. When we started looking at the results, we found some interesting points that we didn’t think of such as different people prefer different sized and weighted pens. This resulted in mixed responses when we asked if they felt the stylus was too heavy. Also, when it came to doing the experiment some people that had never used one got used to it really quickly which I wasn’t expecting.<br><br>

      Overall the assignment was a fun experience on how to make a structured experiment while involving human interaction and their different responses. I have learned a lot from this experience and would do this experiment different if I did it again, such as making it more interview based and asking more personal questions such as “Would you buy this?”. I loved exploring all the aspects that go into a product the how it works, why it works this way, on top of who would use it and what its purpose is.<br><br>
