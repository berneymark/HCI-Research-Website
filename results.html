        <p>I feel you need a large deck to utilize it.</p>

        <p>The weight of it feels pretty good.</p>
        <p><em>Any additional feedback?</em></p>
        <p>If the stylus had a little more grip or rubber on it I think it would be perfect.</p>

        <p>It felt a bit too heavy.</p>
        <p><em>Any additional feedback?</em></p>
        <p>As a first time user I feel that it’s very hard to use but with practice I feel like it would be very helpful.</p>

        <p>Not at all my arm kept running out of space when trying to use it in the bottom corners.</p>
        <p><em>Does the stylus feel too light or heavy?</em></p>
        <p>I’m not sure as I haven’t used any other stylus.</p>

        <p><em>Do you feel you had enough space on the pad?</em></p>
        <p>At first I felt like I didn’t have space but once I got to the signature test I thought it was fine.</p>
        <p><em>Does the stylus feel too light or heavy?</em></p>
        <p>Had no problems with the weight.</p>

        <p><em>Do you feel you had enough space on the pad?</em></p>
        <p>There was enough space</p>
        <p><em>Does the stylus feel too light or heavy?</em></p>
        <p>The weight was balanced enough and not heavy</p>
        <p><em>Any additional feedback?</em></p>
        <p>Maybe a better tip to write with</p>

        <p><em>Do you feel you had enough space on the pad?</em></p>
        <p>Space wasn’t a problem, but more would have been nice.</p>
        <p><em>Does the stylus feel too light or heavy?</em></p>
        <p>Actually feels too light and plastic-y.</p>
        <p><em>Any additional feedback?</em></p>
        <p>Maybe a digital rubber at one end - a bit more weight to it would be nice too.</p>

        <p><em>Do you feel you had enough space on the pad?</em></p>
        <p>Was generous considering the pen size and once I became accommodated to it</p>
        <p><em>Does the stylus feel too light or heavy?</em></p>
        <p>Personally prefer a weightier pen</p>
        <p><em>Any additional feedback?</em></p>
        <p>Perhaps some gripping texture could be used</p>

        <p>Yeah, it's alright</p>
        <p><em>Does the stylus feel too light or heavy?</em></p>
        <p>Good weight</p>
        <p><em>Any additional feedback?</em></p>
        <p>Soft, cushy grip would be better for long periods of use especially for artists</p>
