        <h3>Results Summary</h3>
        <p>
          Based on the results we got from the experiment most people that knew how to set it up were good at using the stylus. This will probably have to do with them having some sort of technical experience or expertise and vise versa for people who had a difficult time. The outliner in the experiment would be User 4 and User 6, as User 4 didn’t make any mistakes during the maze experiment and had a perfect signature, which means he must of used a stylus before in their life. Then for User 6 they had no idea how to set up or use the stylus, this user must have little to no technical experience or expertise or some sort of physical disability that makes their hand unstable for this to happen.<br><br>
          Based on the results we got from the interview most people found the stylus somewhat like the stylus and the comfort of it which tells me that the stylus itself is a good design for holding and writing with. Almost everyone thought there needed to be more space on the pad which tells me that if they gave more space for support then it would be better. The stylus weight was a mixed response across the board which makes me think that it’s a preference based utility and if the stylus had a way of adding and removing weight it would be a better product. In addition some people would had liked better grip to improve the pen.

            <p>If the stylus had a little more grip or rubber on it I think it would be perfect.</p>

            <p>The weight was balanced enough and not heavy</p>
            <p><em>Any additional feedback?</em></p>
            <p>Maybe a better tip to write with</p>

            <p>Space wasn’t a problem, but more would have been nice.</p>
            <p><em>Does the stylus feel too light or heavy?</em></p>
            <p>Actually feels too light and plastic-y.</p>
            <p><em>Any additional feedback?</em></p>
            <p>Maybe a digital rubber at one end - a bit more weight to it would be nice too.</p>

            <p>Was generous considering the pen size and once I became accommodated to it</p>
            <p><em>Does the stylus feel too light or heavy?</em></p>
            <p>Personally prefer a weightier pen</p>

            <p>Perhaps some gripping texture could be used</p>

            <p><em>Does the stylus feel too light or heavy?</em></p>
            <p>Good weight</p>
            <p><em>Any additional feedback?</em></p>
            <p>Soft, cushy grip would be better for long periods of use especially for artists</p>

            <p><em>Do you feel you had enough space on the pad?</em></p>
            <p>The wacom pad had adequate space for what i needed to do, but there were some times when i would have liked more space just to have more room to move around and not consistently think about the limited space</p>
            <p><em>Does the stylus feel too light or heavy?</em></p>
            <p>the stylus does not feel too heavy or too light, perfect for me</p>
