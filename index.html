      <h1>Usability of Wacom Intuos Pen and Tablet: Stylus</h1>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The following study will look at the usability of a stylus, the Intuos Pen and Pad, which is made up of a pad that acts as the drawing surface for which the stylus can interact with the computer. Not at all unlike a trackpad for a stylus. We believe the most important aspects of usability for a stylus is: ease of setup and use, accuracy and comfort; so, we have used these as our focuses for our study.<br><br>
        In a world where the primary method of computer input is either your finger or a mouse and keyboard – some power users will need a stylus for certain tasks such as drawing, writing or even for more precise photo and video editing which has become more prominent in recent times on the iPad Pro. The stylus has a future in our lives. The reason we decided to go with the Wacom Intuos is because it is a well-known brand that makes good quality stylus’, and this particular model is considered entry model. Most users will not be willing to get an entirely separate device such as an iPad or Surface Pro when everyone has a laptop, which is exactly what this device was made for.<br><br>
        When put against a mouse or finger, a stylus is more accurate and more precise to tasks that you would ordinarily do with a pen or a pencil. Since the release of devices such as Microsoft’s Surface line-up, Apple’s iPad Pro and Samsung’s Note and Tab S series, we have shown that a stylus can be useful in many other situations including situations such as selecting areas to screenshot or selecting text on a mobile device, with a level of accuracy only a mouse could generally perform.<br><br>
        In order to keep a controlled experiment, we have ensured that every step the setup process that the user fails to complete will be done by whichever member of the team is holding that test. The exact same software, Autodesk Sketchbook will be used as it is recommended and trusted by Wacom and works with all its features.<br><br>
        The purpose of this study has been to look at the stylus, how comfortable and easy it is to use to get your work done, as well as whether it is precise and accurate enough to get what you need done.<br><br>
