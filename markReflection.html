      <h1>Usability of Wacom Intuos Pen and Tablet: Stylus</h1>
      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <h3>Mark Berney</h3>

        I first noticed my interest in computers when my Mum bought us the family iMac in 2008. I would consider myself a bit of a good software geek and would always have preference for elegant, fluid software on average hardware rather than really good hardware which runs pretty subpar software. It was always between graphic design and software development, but I chose software development because I knew I could learn more thing at Uni that I can’t teach myself which I’m not sure I could say the same for design. I consider myself a good problem solver and a creative thinker which has made this degree a perfect fit for me. I wanted to major in software development, so as this paper was a requirement for my major I just went with it. I ended up enjoying it way more than I expected to as there were minimal tests and it was all based on assignment work which I way prefer.<br><br>
        Our research assignment was focusing on the usability of a stylus: - we decided to use the Wacom Intuos Pen and Pad as our focus stylus as Wacom is a well-known and respected brand in the stylus world. However, we recognise different stylus’ will have different experiences. Each member of our team tested three users coming to a total of nine users worth of results.<br><br>
        Only 4:9 participants enabled palm rejection showing that the switch may be a little bit too difficult to find, being a small black switch on the back of the pad. However, only one participant had any issues with setting up, possibly due to lack of technical understanding. This shows us that despite the palm-rejection toggle being difficult, the overall setup of everything else was not too difficult for the average user to get.<br><br>
        The average amount of mistakes made was 6.22 in the maze, with the most being 15 and least being 0. The user who made 15 mistakes was the only one who could not set up the pad so considering that is an outlier, I would consider the stylus to be very accurate, but obviously to perform better for users who are technically familiar, especially those who have used stylus’ before. The signature comparison reaches a similar conclusion.<br><br>
        Users we interviewed seemed to find it reasonably comfortable with each user having something they may like to change. Many requests were for a rubber grip, while most users were happy with the provided space on the pad and the weight of the stylus. Users rated the hold as 3, 4 or 5 while writing was a little lower at 2, 3 or 4. This insinuates that while it was fine to hold it may not have been as comfortable for writing over a period of time. Every participant except one rated the feeling of the hold above that of the feeling of writing.
