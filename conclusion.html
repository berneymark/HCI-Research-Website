      <h1>Usability of Wacom Intuos Pen and Tablet: Stylus</h1>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        We can see based on the results given that most users were at least competent with a stylus. All users except for one was able to set up the Wacom Intuos which shows us that the setup process is not too difficult, however, about half of the users failed to turn on palm rejection. This is enabled by a small black switch at the back of the tablet, which I expected may be difficult to find. Coupled with the fact that commonly stylus’ will have this always on due to its necessity, users may not have even thought to turn it on.<br><br>
        When we look at the maze, you can understand that it is difficult to never hit the side, even with a normal pen, so the one user who made zero mistakes doesn’t negatively affect the experiment. With a 6.22 being the average amount of times the stylus went outside of the lines we can gather from this average score of 3.3 when comparing signatures we can say that the Wacom Intuos is at least accurate enough to use in place of a pen with the possibility of scores being boosted the more users are used to the stylus – or perhaps even with another stylus.<br><br>
        Many users complained that a grip would have helped make the device more comfortable, while most were happy with its weight and size of the tablet. Taking in all of the answers, we would say that the average user will have no issue in comfort using this pen, however over longer periods of time this may not be as comfortable as your average pen or even other stylus’ on the market today.
