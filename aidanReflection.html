      <h1>Usability of Wacom Intuos Pen and Tablet: Stylus</h1>
      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <h3>Aidan Mile-Reeves</h3>
      <p>
        Starting with analysing the initial setup of the stylus, almost all of the participants were able to plug in and get the stylus running. The only participant (User 6) unable to do so wasn’t able to enable palm rejection, had a high amount of mistakes on the maze and their signature accuracy was the lowest. An assumption could be made of this participant that they are extremely unfamiliar with any modern technology.
        Because every other participant was able to complete the initial setup, we can assume they at least use some form of technology regularly.<br><br>

        From the results, only four out of nine (or 44%) of the participants enabled palm rejection. This seems to suggest that the stylus is not as user-friendly as it should be. Although it should be noted that because the sample size was so low, this could be quite inaccurate.<br><br>

        Onto the maze accuracy, participant 4 didn’t make any mistakes at all, s/he is definitely an outlier for this experiment. If we assume that the participants wouldn’t make any mistakes doing the maze with pen & paper, then we would also assume that the stylus isn’t as accurate as a pen. The mean average works out to be 6.22 mistakes per user. This is too many mistakes to be considered accurate.<br><br>

        The signature accuracy test results show that the participants for the most part are adequate or quite good, with only a couple of exceptions.<br><br>

        The users all rated holding the stylus quite high, with a mean average rating of 3.89 and a median of 4. With 3 being average to hold, this means that all the participants found the stylus average to great to hold.<br><br>

        Onto writing with the stylus, the mean average is 2.89, which is barely passable. Not a single participant rated writing with it above a 4. A large amount of the additional feedback notes how modifications to the stylus could improve it, mentioning how a new tip or grip would make the experience much better to use.
